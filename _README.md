### Installing Dependencies

1) Clone this repo to your desktop and run npm install at the root directory to install server dependencies.

2) Run npm install in the client2 folder to install client dependencies.

3) Once the dependencies are installed, run node server.js in the /server directory.

4) You will then be able to access the application from http://localhost:8080/.

For further development of the front-end, any changes to the code needs to be compiled using webpack. To run webpack, run webpack in the client2 folder.
